            <h3 class="display-5">How to better incorporate collaboration in a business?</h2>
              <p>There are many ways to improve and include collaboration in your business, such as
                allowing employees to work together to achieve their daily goals. Many times by
                incorporating different outlooks on a project it can be completed in a shorter
                amount of time and at a better standard as with more view points more issues can
                be found and fixed as well as more innovative ideas can be presented. </p>
              <p>Another such example could be breaking up tasks and assigning them to groups rather
                than individuals. Doing so allows more flexibility in how the tasks can be achieved
                and not giving each person a set role allows for employees to play off of each
                other’s strengths rather than having them struggle if they are stuck on a task
                they have been assigned. </p>

            <h2 class="display-5">Why is collaboration integral to a successful business?</h2>
            <p>Collaboration is an essential part in a successful modern business.
              It is key to ensure that multiple people review products for
              defects and issues, if more than one person has been working on a
              task there are less chances of mistakes slipping through. Having your
              employees work together does this without the need to take much extra
              time for reviewing.</p>
            <p>It is also beneficial to have collaboration in the workplace as it
              allows for new ideas. The more people working on a project the
              more viewpoints you have, and the more room for innovation whether
              it’s the idea of an individual in the group or result of the groups
              ideas combined to find the best outcome.</p>
            <p>Good collaboration allows for a better more efficient company
              with more innovative ideas. The more people working on a task the
              better the outcome as long as they are working together and not
              against each other. If your workers aren’t collaborating then
              they are just causing resistance and slowing everything down,
              which needless to say is bad for business.</p>
